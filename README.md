## Introduction
The goal of the project was to develop ML models ob a dataset that has irregularities and anomalies. For taht reason the project is splited in two main parts. The first part includes the preprocessing of the data and the devlopment of a pipeline that it can transform the data initially to a state that is required from the ML models and secondly to increase the information that we can obtain from the original data for better perfomance. For the second part of the project we implement few ML models and compare the results on a test dataset.

## Dataset
The project works with a subset of " Tomczak,Sebastian. (2016). Polish companies bankruptcy data. UCI Machine Learning Repository." which is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/365/polish+companies+bankruptcy+data). The dataset contains financial information about Polish companies analyzed in the period 2000-2012 and the data were collected from Emerging Markets Information Service(EMIS). Specifically, for each company the dataset contains 64 annual financial statistics and also a label that indicates bankruptcy status after certain amount of years.
